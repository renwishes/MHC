        <p> Depression, or major depressive disorder, is a common but serious mood disorder characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed. Other symptoms include changes in appetite and weight, sleep disturbances, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide.
Depression can be caused by a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. It often co-occurs with other mental health disorders, such as anxiety, and chronic physical conditions like diabetes and heart disease.</p>
      
<p>Diagnosis is based on a thorough clinical assessment, including the patient's history, symptom duration, and impact on daily functioning. Treatment typically involves a combination of medication and psychotherapy. Antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are commonly prescribed to help regulate mood. Psychotherapies, like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT), focus on changing negative thought patterns and improving interpersonal relationships.
Lifestyle changes, such as regular physical activity, a healthy diet, adequate sleep, and stress management techniques, also play a vital role in managing depression. Support from family, friends, and support groups can provide additional emotional assistance.</p>
