        <p>PTSD is a mental health condition triggered by experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event, such as a natural disaster, serious accident, terrorist act, war/combat, rape, or other violent personal assaults. Symptoms include intrusive memories (flashbacks, nightmares), avoidance behaviors (avoiding places, people, activities that remind one of the trauma), negative changes in thinking and mood (negative beliefs about oneself or the world, feelings of detachment), and changes in physical and emotional reactions (irritability, aggressive behavior, heightened startle response).
Not everyone exposed to trauma develops PTSD. Risk factors include the intensity of the trauma, previous mental health issues, lack of social support, and additional stress after the event. </p>
<p>Diagnosis involves a psychological evaluation that includes discussing the symptoms and their impact on daily life. Treatment for PTSD often includes psychotherapy, such as cognitive processing therapy (CPT), prolonged exposure therapy, and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). Medications, including antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs, can also help manage symptoms.
Self-care practices, like maintaining a healthy lifestyle, connecting with supportive people, and practicing mindfulness or relaxation techniques, can be beneficial. Support groups provide a space for individuals to share their experiences and coping strategies. </p>
